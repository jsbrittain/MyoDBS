# MyoDBS

This project classifies arm movements (and muscle contractions) obtained through a Myo Armband in real-time using logistic regression, providing triggers for use to stimulate brain activity in order to suppress unwanted actions (e.g. tremor). The system is designed for use with Deep Brain Stimulation. The sample dataset classifies grasp-vs-relaxed arm conditions.
